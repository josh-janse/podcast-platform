# Interactive Podcasting Platform Brief

## Overview
A platform that enables users to host and share interactive podcasts with AI co-hosts. Users can upload source content which AI hosts will discuss in a conversational format, while listeners can join the conversation to ask questions and receive answers based on the source material.

## Core Features

### Podcast Creation
1. Upload source materials (articles, documents, research papers)
2. Generate an interactive podcast where two AI hosts discuss the key points
3. Customize discussion topics with a steering prompt (up to 500 characters)
4. Generation takes several minutes - users can perform other tasks during this time

### Interactive Listening Experience
1. Standard listening mode for regular podcast consumption
2. Interactive mode where listeners can:
   - Join the conversation with a tap of a button
   - Ask questions directly to the AI hosts
   - Receive personalized answers based on source materials
   - Return to the original podcast after their question is answered

### Sharing & Distribution
1. Generate shareable public links for podcasts
2. Download podcasts for offline sharing
3. Embed podcasts on websites and social media

### Language Support
1. Multi-language podcast generation (initially prioritize English)
2. Set default language in user settings
3. Option to generate translations of existing podcasts

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Next.js with shadcn/ui components
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Audio player with interactive controls
- Upload interface for source materials

### Backend
- Node.js server for handling podcast management
- AI integration for generating podcast content and handling interactive questions
- Audio processing capabilities
- Storage solution for source materials and generated podcasts

### AI Components
- Text analysis of source materials
- Natural-sounding voice synthesis for multiple AI hosts
- Real-time question processing during interactive sessions
- Content accuracy verification

## User Experience Flow

1. **Create Podcast**: Upload source materials and optionally add steering prompt
2. **Wait for Generation**: Backend processes materials and generates podcast
3. **Listen/Share**: Play podcast, enable interactive mode, or share with others
4. **Interact**: Join conversation to ask questions when in interactive mode

## Limitations & Considerations

- AI-generated voices may have occasional glitches
- Generation time depends on source material length and complexity
- Voice interactions not stored for privacy reasons
- Shared podcasts only available in standard (non-interactive) mode
- Need to ensure content accuracy from source materials

## Future Enhancements

- Community features for discovering popular podcasts
- Analytics for podcast creators
- Multiple voice options for AI hosts
- Transcription and searchable podcast content
- Integration with major podcast distribution platforms

This platform would enable anyone to create engaging, interactive podcast-like content without the typical overhead of podcast production, while allowing listeners to participate in the discussion and gain deeper insights through direct questioning.
